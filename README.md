## Nov3l - Client

### A Full-stack Web3 Fiction Library

Nov3l is a personal project that allows users to upload fiction and to fund fiction they like with Ethereum. When fiction is uploaded, an NFT is minted to help prove ownership of the work.

This is the client. You simply need to download the repo and run

```
npm install
```

to get cracking.

_Note: _ You'll also need:

1. The backend server available in my other repo <a href="https://github.com/MK3nn3dy/nov3l-server">here</a>. The Read Me there gives more info on running this.

2. Your own smart contract on the Sepolia Ethereum test net. Download the web3 project <a href="https://github.com/MK3nn3dy/nov3l-smart-contract">here</a> and follow the Read Me to get started.
